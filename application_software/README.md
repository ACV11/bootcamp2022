Welcome to the application software track of the bootcamp. In the next few weeks, we will be developing a working web server from scratch in C/C++. 

For this track, you should be familiar with the following concepts: socket programming, multi-threading, performance testing. Ideally, you should be familiar with all the topics in our NPTEL course [Design and Engineering of Computer Systems](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/decs/). At the very least, you should be comfortable with lectures 1 to 8, 16 to 18, 21 to 24, 26, 31 to 33. 

Please follow the weekly exercises in this folder in order.
