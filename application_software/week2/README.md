# Bootcamp Week 2 : Simple echo client/server with multi-threading

This week, we will build a simple echo client-server application, with multi-threading at the server. Please work thorugh the following tasks in order.

## Exercise 1: Single-threaded echo client and server

Your first task is to write simple C/C++ client-server programs using the socket API. In this exercise, the client should send a message to the server, and the server should simply echo it back to the client. That is, the server must send the same message back to the client. The server should keep doing this as long as the client is connected to it. It is enough if your programs work for a single client connected to a server for now.

Below are two video lectures to understand the concept of socket programming required to solve this exercise (you can watch either one):

Now, consider the simple client and server programs provided to you in this repository. You can use them as a guide to write your own code. The server program given to you takes one command line argument: the port number on which to listen. The client program takes two arguments: the server hostname and port number. You can give ```localhost``` as the hostname if you are running the client and server on the same machine. Once the client and server are connected to each other, the client sends a message to the server and gets a reply back. 

Here is the output from these simple programs given to you  (the client and server programs must be run in separate terminals):

   ```console
    $gcc server.c -o server
    $./server 5000
    Here is the message: Hello
 ```
   ```console
    $gcc client.c -o client
    $./client localhost 5000
    Please enter the message: Hello
    I got your message
```

Please understand these sample programs and all the socket-related system calls completely. Also note the use of functions like ```htons``` to convert from host order to network order when communicating data over the network. Once you understand these examples, use this code as a template to write your own echo client and server in C or C++. Unlike this sample server, your server must echo back exactly the message received from the client. Also, it must repeatedly read data from the client and echo it back, and not just quit after one message exchange. 

Complete writing this simple echo client and server, and test it thoroughly, before you proceed to the next exercise.

## Exercise 2: Introduction to multi-threading

In the server program written by you so far, the main server process is accepting the client connection and also serving it (by reading data and writing back a reply). Next, you will modify your server to handle the client processing in a separate thread. Once the server accepts a new connection, it will create a new thread, and it will pass the client's socket file descriptor (returned by accept) to this new thread. This thread will then read and write messages to the client. 

To get started, here are some video lectures on threads: [Threads video lecture 1](https://youtu.be/Y1PF0fE-v9M), [Threads video lecture 2](https://youtu.be/SVHLonf5AGY)

We will use the pthread library available in C/C++ to create threads. This document has a detailed explanation of the pthreads library and its functions: [introduction to Pthread API](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-api.pdf). Sections 27.1 and 27.2 explain thread creation. 

You can include the pthreads library in your programs by including this header file:

```#include <pthread.h>```

When writing code using this library, you must use the ```-lpthread``` flag to compile your code. 

The pthread library has several useful functions. You can create a thread using the pthread_create() function present in this library. When you create a thread to handle a client request at your server, you must pass the accepted client file descriptor as an argument to the thread function, so that it can read and write from the client. Understand how arguments are passed to threads, and be careful with pointers and casting. Here is sample code that creates a thread and passes it an argument:

   ```console
    void *start_function(void *arg) {
        int my_arg = *((int *) arg);
        //...thread processing...
    }

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        int thread_arg = 0;
        pthread_t thread_id;
        
        pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, start_function, &thread_arg);

        //...more code...

    }
```

Change your server from exercise 1 to handle the accepted client in a separate thread as described above. The created thread will focus on communicating with the client given to it as an argument at creation time, while the main server thread can go back to accepting new connections. In this way, your server can perform the echo service with multiple clients at the same time. First, write code to create one thread to handle one client. Then extend this code to handle a small number of clients (say 5 or 10) in separate threads.

You can check that your server is handling a small number of clients at the same time by opening separate terminals, and connecting multiple clients to the server from the different terminals. You should find that the server is correctly able to echo back the messages received from the multiple clients.

## Exercise 3: Server thread pool

The final task for this week is to create a multi-threaded server by creating a pool of worker threads. In the previous exercise, you were creating a separate thread for each client. However, thread creation is a high overhead task. Therefore, real-life multi-threaded servers use a pool of reusable worker threads instead. The main server creates a pool of worker threads at the start. Whenever a new client connection is accepted, the server places the accepted client file descriptor in a queue/array shared with the workers. Each worker thread fetches a client from this queue, and serves it as long as the client is connected. Once the client finishes and terminates, the worker thread goes back to the queue to get the next client to handle. In this way, the same pool of worker threads can serve multiple clients.

Begin by watching this video to understand the multi-threaded design pattern of servers: [Video lecture on multi-threaded application design](https://youtu.be/TXZqpu4zmLI)

More video lectures on [Locking](https://youtu.be/EBevKfTDXUI) and [Condition Variables](https://youtu.be/rMpOfbaP2PQ)

To design a thread pool, you must first create multiple threads. Next, you will need a shared buffer or queue to store the accepted client file descriptors. You can use a large array or a C++  [queue](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/) or any such data structure for this purpose. The main server thread and the worker threads must use locks to access this queue without race conditions. Next, the main server thread and worker threads will use condition variables to signal each other when clients are added or removed from the queue. Carefully study the various functions available to correctly use locks and condition variables from this [introduction to Pthread API](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-api.pdf)

After you make these changes, your server will be able to handle multiple clients concurrently as before, but without having to create a new thread for every client. Start your server in one terminal. Open separate terminals to start several different clients, and check that all of them can correctly communicate with the echo server. You can also print out some debug output to check that clients are correctly being assigned to worker threads, and that the worker thread is serving another client after the first client terminates.
