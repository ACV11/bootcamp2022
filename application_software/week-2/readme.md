# Bootcamp Week 2 : Application Software
# Simple echo client/server with multi-threading

## Overview

In this lab you will learn building a server-client model in cpp where the server is capable of handling multiple client requests concurrently. Sockets are a mechanism for exchanging data between processes. These processes can either be on the same machine, or on different machines connected via a network. Once a socket connection is established, data can be sent in both directions until one of the endpoints closes the connection. Generally, the application requesting the data is called the **client** and the application servicing the request is called the **server**.
