### Useful links to learn:

- https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/decs/ (Lecture 31 to 33)

## TODO

- Create a simple http server with no mem leaks
- Add a bash script to run it in loops
- Define some performance measures from slides
- Give plotting script or templates
- Ask them to run load testing on their code after removing mem leaks
